# Optimal-Model-Architecture-of-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-with-Genetic-Algorithms
This paper proposes a new approach that aims at finding the best ensemble model architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks using the power of Transfer Learning from several CNNs to classify images. The search for the optimal model was optimized using Genetic Algorithms.
